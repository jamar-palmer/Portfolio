        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        <h2><i>I'm</i> <b>Jamar Palmer</b></h2>
        <p>I am a Temple University student, focused on improving my expertise every single day. After earning numerous tech certifications, I've found programming to be the most
            enjoyable. New fascinating technologies emerge constantly and implementing them into my projects provides both challenge and satisfaction. 
        </br>
        I love stimulating myself with new activities constantly as an open perspective is very beneficial in development as well as any other situation. My hobbies include 
        bass guitar practice, Spanish improvement, exercising, cooking (poorly), and watching sports/anime/romantic comedies featuring Adam Sandler.

        <p>Temple University's College of Science and Technology does a fantastic job at providing opportunities to foucs on the concentration of your choosing. I was able to 
            get strong infrastructure knowledge while advancing my programming skills.

        <h3>Certifications</h3>
        <p>CompTIA certifications are excellent tests to validate one's expertise in a field. The A+ focuses on gaining the problem solving mentality that is imperative for every IT
            professional. The Network+ covers cloud and networking technologies and maintenance. The Security+ covers policies and practices along with vulnerablility assessment and 
            penetration testing.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
        <h3>Software Engineer Intern</h3>
        <h3><i>United States Liability Insurance</i></h3>
        <p>This company allows for interns to branch out and gain experience equal to that of a full-time position. What started as writing simple scripts and improving documentation
            evolved into application development once I was acclimated. Using C# and JavaScript, we created new forms and additions to the intranet while unit testing for safe 
            integration. The automation of some tasks using Python in conjunction with Azure, proved to be beneficial self-study.
        </p>
        <h3>Retail Store Associate</h3>
        <h3><i>CVS Pharmacy</i></h3>
        <p>I believe that all people should work a retail/customer-oriented job for a brief period and I got this experience with CVS. The social skills that are obtained through
            constant interaction is invaluable and networking can be surprisingly fruitful. Small management roles allowed me to gain leadership experience and time management was 
            crucial for completing the daily duties.
