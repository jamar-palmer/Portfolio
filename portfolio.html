        <h1>Hey!</h1>
        <h2><i>I'm</i> <b>Jamar Palmer</b></h2>
        <p>I am a Temple University student, focused on improving my expertise every single day. After earning numerous tech certifications, I've found programming to be the most
            enjoyable. New fascinating technologies emerge constantly and implementing them into my projects provides both challenge and satisfaction. 
        </br>
        I love stimulating myself with new activities constantly as an open perspective is very beneficial in development as well as any other situation. My hobbies include 
        bass guitar practice, Spanish improvement, exercising, cooking (poorly), and watching sports/anime/romantic comedies featuring Adam Sandler.
